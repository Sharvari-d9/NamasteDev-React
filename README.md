# _What is react_

- Javascript library created by Meta developers

- two scripts that are include , one is core react javascript code and other one is DOM development code

- Philosophy with which react was created was to handle the most expensive function in any web application that is DOM manipulation. for ex: clicking a button can add or remove elements. All libraries try to optimize this as much as possible
